Our goal is to create a game that can teach people sign language so that when a disable person communicates he/she doesn't feel inferior.
If this app comes out to be good in future then it can be then integrated into the curriculum of Students in schools so that we can head towards a better good

WHAT IS THE APPROACH??
these are the steps:-
1. Create a cnn model that can detect hands with accuracy 
2. Load and make this model into a frontend for better UI/UX
3. Make and convert into a game where you will have to show a perfect sign for particular letter in order to score more in the game
